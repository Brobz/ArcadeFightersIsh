# Instructions
After signing up and logging in (instructions on webpage), either join an existing room by providing its name, or create a brand new one,
where you will be the host. The first player to join will be assigned room host, and can choose when to start the game, and other room settings.
Once the game begins, use WASD keys to move around and the arrow keys to shoot. Grab power ups and use positioning to eliminate other players.
The map is randomly generated each game.

# Room Settings
The room host may select the max amount of players for the room, as well as the game mode, which can be either Free For All or Team Deathmatch.
